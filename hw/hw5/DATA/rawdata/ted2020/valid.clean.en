In about five billion years , our sun will become a red giant , as large as the Earth's orbit , and our Earth will be kaput , and in a thousand billion years , if dark energy keeps on fueling space expansion at the present rate , you will not even be able to see as far as your toes , because everything around you expands at a rate faster than the speed of light .

The endocrine system relies on interactions between three features to do its job: glands , hormones , and trillions of cell receptors .
To find its targets , it’s helped along by receptors , which are special proteins inside or on the cell’s surface .
We have three fluidic channels .
It's open source , meaning we publish and share all of our design files and all of our code online , allowing anyone to modify or improve or change the design .

It sounds totally crazy .
This caterpillar is a headbanging zombie bodyguard defending the offspring of the creature that killed it .
We have a lot to get through . I only have 13 minutes . Now , some of you are probably just desperately clawing for some solace in the idea that these things are oddities of the natural world , that they are outliers , and that point of view is understandable , because by their nature , parasites are quite small and they spend a lot of their time inside the bodies of other things .

" 7000 " series Polish literature .
Large amounts of data , expert physicians and expert medical imaging technologies .
And I think that thinking about traditional AI , which is datarich but applicationpoor , we should also continue thinking about unorthodox artificial intelligence architectures , which can accept small amounts of data and solve some of the most important problems facing us today , especially in health care .
They basically said , " Let's work on this in an open , crowdsourced , team way to do this decoding . "

Miguel was confused by this as well and really quite embarrassed by it .
Or the other guy , who asked me for a budget to build a cheese factory next to our plant in Ecuador , in the village .
It was indeed true that the stories of history were told by its old victors , but I am of a new generation .
